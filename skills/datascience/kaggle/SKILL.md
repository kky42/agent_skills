# kaggle

Reusable Kaggle operating skill.

Use this skill for Kaggle competition work and reusable Kaggle methodology.
Keep competition-specific facts, paths, commands, scores, deadlines, notebook
inventories, discussion findings, and host quirks in the active repo's docs or
refs, not in this skill.

## Autonomy

Once the user asks for a Kaggle workflow, operate end to end. Submissions and
dataset create/version actions are allowed when they are part of the requested
objective. Record source, command, timestamp, artifact path, and feedback for
any external Kaggle action.

After recording a leaderboard result, refresh the competition context and
verify no stale blockers remain before the next cycle. A completed submission
can be the current best while cached context still tells the next agent to
verify it.

## Core Kaggle Principles

- Optimize for private leaderboard performance; public LB is evidence, not
  truth.
- Treat evaluation design as the central artifact: public/private split,
  hidden-test construction, metric behavior, and submission budget drive the
  whole workflow.
- Start from official rules, metric, data, runtime, and submission contract.
- Build trustworthy validation before adding capacity.
- Keep the training/evaluation loop fast, cheap, calibrated, and reproducible
  so more ideas can be tested without burning submissions.
- Label leakage risk for public notebooks, discussions, features, and artifacts.
- Prefer robust, reproducible candidates over brittle public-LB tuning.
- Record provenance, hypothesis, local score, optional LB score, configs, seeds,
  artifacts, and decisions for every candidate.

## Router

Open only the reference needed for the current operation.

CLI-only operations:

- Verify Kaggle access: `./refs/cli/auth.md`
- List/download competition data: `./refs/cli/data.md`
- Submit and check feedback: `./refs/cli/submit.md`
- List/pull/publish notebook source/output: `./refs/cli/notebooks.md`
- Create/version datasets: `./refs/cli/datasets.md`
- Browse discussion topics/comments with official CLI support:
  `./refs/cli/discussions.md`

Script-backed operations, only where the Kaggle CLI is insufficient:

- Local routine cache/search: `./refs/scripts/cache.md`
- Competition page sections: `./refs/scripts/comp_page.md`
- Notebook search snapshots: `./refs/scripts/nb_list.md`
- Notebook version artifact download: `./refs/scripts/nb_download.md`
- Discussion topic list/filter with preserved raw metadata:
  `./refs/scripts/disc_list.md`
- Fetch a full discussion thread (opening post + nested comment tree with
  author names, votes, dates): `./refs/scripts/disc_get.md`
- Notebook official/pinned flags: `./refs/scripts/nb_flags.md`
- Notebook version/score updates: `./refs/scripts/nb_versions.md`
- NVIDIA-derived helpers for writeups, public kernel score/version archives,
  Rich discussion/kernel SQLite browsing, submission quota checks,
  code-competition kernel submission polling, dataset uploads, and local kernel
  reproduction: `./refs/scripts/nvidia.md`

Browser-backed operations (requires OpenCLI, see `./refs/opencli-setup.md`):

- Fallback for any interactive task not supported by the CLI or scripts
  (post discussion topics, reply to comments, notebook comments, etc.):
  `./refs/kaggle-interaction.md`

Long-running public source tracking must preserve author identities where
available: user id, user name, display name, profile URL, tier, and raw source
payload. Do this for notebooks, discussion topics, and comments so later
user-centric clue gathering can join across sources.

For ongoing competition work, prefer caching routine Kaggle evidence under the
active repo's `.kaggle-skill/cache/` directory and keep that path ignored by git.
Search the local cache first when the user asks for previously refreshed
competition brief, notebook, discussion, or submission information; refresh
manually when the user asks for current data.

For periodic public notebook/discussion syncs, use a delta-first workflow: fast
list snapshots, compare stable signatures, fetch details only for new/changed or
high-signal items, and summarize only those deltas. For large changed sets, split
items into batches and use read-only subagents rather than rereading everything
in the main context.

Methodology:

- General Kaggle principles: `./refs/general/README.md`
- Competition strategy briefs with citations, score ladders, and honest plots:
  `./refs/general/research_brief.md`

External resources for future maintenance:

- NVIDIA nvidia-kaggle upstream and merged snapshot notes:
  `./refs/nvidia-kaggle.md`

## Update Boundary

Add to this skill only when the lesson is reusable across Kaggle competitions
and does not depend on one repo's scripts, file layout, model format, or
competition-specific metric details.

Examples that belong here:

- how to reason about public/private leaderboard mismatch
- how to design out-of-fold or group/time-aware validation
- how to evaluate public notebook claims
- how to record artifact provenance and prevent accidental leakage

Examples that belong in the repo:

- competition slug, task ids, paths, scripts, solver ids, submission ids
- exact package pins, host helper quirks, dated leaderboard observations
- downloaded notebook/discussion inventories
- local tool commands and workflow conventions

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep internal skill paths relative to the skill root, e.g. `./refs/...` and
  `./scripts/...`; never hardcode agent runtime install roots.
- Keep `SKILL.md` as the first-layer index and boundary contract.
- Use CLI docs for simple Kaggle CLI operations; do not add scripts for them.
- Add scripts only for scraping, comment extraction, official/pinned detection,
  or structured aggregation that the CLI cannot reliably do.
- Keep scripts independent and single-purpose.
- Keep vendored external helpers namespaced under their source directory and
  preserve license attribution.
- Add lessons to the narrowest existing reference file when possible.
- Add a new subfolder only for a reusable Kaggle methodology area that does not
  fit the current second-layer index.
- Replace repeated examples with one generalized rule.
- Move competition-specific or stale operational details into the active repo's
  docs, not this skill.
